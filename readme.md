#Grunt Test#

##Setup##

###Install grunt-cli###

```npm install -g grunt-cli```
Only needs to be done once, the -g is for global

###install dependencies###

```npm install```
Required for each project

###start watching###

```grunt watch```
Can just use grunt to build a one-off, watch is better for dev though
